# Setup

There is an alternative approach with Typescript an ts-jest:
- https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/user/babel7-or-ts
-->

This is the setup of a  Test-Driven Typescript-Node application that can be started with a bash-command.

The NodeJs application builds and starts a React application.

## Initialize 

Initialize the `npm` project with default values

```bash
npm init -y
```

Edit it the base data

```json
{
  "name": "publishable",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Dr. Frank Zickert",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## Project structure

- Add `docs` folder
- Add `src` folder
- add `.gitignore`


## Add Build Process with Typescript, Babel, and Nodemon

### Babel configuration


install the `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm i -D @babel/core @babel/node nodemon

```


we add an `index.js` file to `src`. This is a NodeJs script. This is the only file we use as plain
Javascript. Because we want to test it right away. We will add features implemented in Typescript once
we have Typescript setup complete.

in the `package.json`, add a script:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js"
},
```

Run it with `npm start` lets you change the code. Nodemon detects this change and restarts the software.


With node, you are able to start your application by running the npm start script.
The only remaining concern is that you have to start the script every time you want
to try your source code. You can change this behavior with an always-running node process.
To remedy this, install the commonly used nodemon library on the command
line as development dependency to your project.

Of course, we don't want to write everything in plain Javascript.


Babel is the Javascript transpiler. It allows us to use latest features of ECMA Script during development
while the resulting code is compatible with older environments.

change the `start`-script to:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec babel-node src/index.js"
},
```

Nothing should change when you run the application again,
though that's just the surface. Under the hood, Babel transpiles your code to vanilla JavaScript.
When you use an upcoming JavaScript language feature, which hasn't been introduced in Node.js,
you can still use the feature in your source code. Babel makes sure that Node.js understands it.

Add the required package:

```bash
npm i -D @babel/preset-env 
```

TODO: refer to `babel.config.js`.


### Typescript configuration

Beyond latest ECMAScript functions, we want to use Typescript.


```bash
npm i -D typescript @babel/preset-typescript
```

Add the preset to the `babel.config.js`.

Typescript files have a different file extension (`.ts`). In order to tell Babel to look
for these extensions, we need to install and use: `@babel/register`

```bash
npm i -D typescript @babel/register
```

TODO: refer to `babel.config.js` of how to use `@babel/register`

create a simple Typescript file: `dummy.ts`.

```ts
export const sayHello = () => {
    console.log("hello world");
};
```

When we start the app, we can see that it works. But it does not hot reload changes in the typescript file.
Nodemon does not detect these changes. It only detects changes in the js-file. But when that changes, it loads
the new typescript file, too.

see:  {@link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37979489/how-to-watch-and-reload-ts-node-when-typescript-files-change}

We externalize the `nodemon` configuration into:

```json
{
    "watch": ["src"],
    "ext": ["ts", "js"],
    "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
    "exec": "babel-node src/index.js"
}
```

If you need to provide further arguments to the `index.js` script, provide it in this configuration file.

change the start script to:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon"
},
```

Typescript checks the types. How (and how strict) it does it depends on its configuration.
Add a `tsconfig.json`. 

TODO: link to `tsconfig.json`

### Test

We use Jest.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest
```

`@types/jest` lets Typescript know about the types when using jest in a `.spec.ts`. 
This is helpful when  writing the test cases in typescript.


Add the script:

The `-- coverage` option produces an overview of the part of the overall code covered by
test cases.

```json 
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest --config ./jest.config.js --coverage"
}
```

And add the `jest.config.js`:

Again, we use the Javascript version to configure our tool so that we can 
use Publishable.

TODO: refer to `jest.config.js`

We implement a first test case in a test suite in this new file:

TODO: refer to `output.spec.ts`

Last but not least, add another npm script for watching your Jest tests.
By using this command, you can have your tests running continuously in one command line tab,
while you start your application in another command line tab.

Every time you change source code while developing your application, 
your tests will run again with this watch script.

```json
"scripts": {
    test:watch": "npm run test -- --watch"
}
```

It calls the `test` script and adds the `--watch` flag.
