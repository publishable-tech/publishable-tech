# Commands

## What are commands and what do they do?

What commands do: refer to index.js/COMMANDS

## Add a command / mode

- add to index.js/COMMANDS
- add a matcher to index.js/@ref commandswitch
- add the mode's implementation

## NPM Start

The command needs to be added to the `nodemon.json`, 

for instance:

```json
"exec": "babel-node src/index.js start"
```
